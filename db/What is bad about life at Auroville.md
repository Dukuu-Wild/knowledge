# What is bad about life at Auroville



## Ссылки
(https://www.quora.com/What-is-bad-about-life-at-Auroville)

As an indian, I found certain things about Auroville sketchy. At the risk of sounding biased here they are

1.  Auroville says that its a community run by volunteers. But even if you stay there for two days, you will notice that all the real work is being done by working class indians. From serving, to housekeeping, to cleaning and so on who are drawing salaries for their service.
2.  A lot of Auroville is really to attract Europeans. And most come loaded. They spend leisure time away from 1st world problems. And really believe/have bought into the life of leisure, and ‘self - sustenance’ in a way.
3.  There are very few ‘índian’ aurovillians. But a lot of employed aurovillians. Which is really questionable.
4.  Although the idea of ‘self-sustanance’ is quite noble. I have found it to be lacking in several contexts in the present day auroville. Case in point: There are almost no roads. But then, they allow people to hire bikes, and two wheelers that run on diesel and kerosene. Which causes a lot of pollution. Some of these mopets and bikes are run on Kerosene and diesel. And of course the fuel is not broken down in an efficient way. Thereby creating a lot of pollution. Also, these bikes which are hired and driven with the auroville campus - are not regulated or checked for pollution. So, its one of the the things you question about the place.
5.  Hospitals: with so many people coming in and out. Its a matter of wonder though how a place can sustain itself, without really having a good-fully equipped hospital in vicinity. There is a health centre, but I really wonder what do people do when in emergency?
6.  The schools: the children of Auroville go to schools where they apparently learn about how to live/sustain in the wild. Unfortunately, you will also notice that questions about the schooling system, and any curiosity is very casually but cautiously shut down.
7.  The good stuff: the matri-mandir. Its definitely an experience to go to the lotus pond and the matri mandir. The effort and the vision that went into making it is remarkable. And the promised experience - is quite true.
8.  The good stuff: the great Banyan. Its the tree around which the whole city is centrally planned. Quite humbling. But then, so is everything to do with Earth and Nature, isn't it? While you stand under the tree, you will also experience the opposite of it - where you see so much land, tree-less. And that too why? its because of ‘man’ it is heartbreaking. Aurovillians will tell you that the land around the matrimandir is still WIP as for all the barren land - there is a plan in place. And soon there will be gardens where there is barren land.
9.  The good stuff: Food. Both the food at solar kitchen, and the smaller lesser known places is totally volunteer run (Again, read: indians employed, not really ‘volunteers’ because - if it was truly volunteer run - then you would see lot more whites and browns mixed. But such is not the case, unfortunately.)
10.  The good stuff: Some of their effort in conserving forests. Is sure amazing.
11.  The good stuff: The places to stay - from Japanese styled housing. To tents, and dorms. There is something for everyone.
12.  The good stuff: the lessons. For someone who is staying there, you can access many many skills. And learn a lot of interesting things that most of us have a hard time accessing even in the top cities. For e.g from arts and culture to health and wellness. There is something for everyone.
13.  Last note: This place really sends a message of being hidden - in plain sight. It really takes a long time to decipher and really understand what is really ‘hidden-hidden’ and what is intentionally there for you to see.
14.  Last note: All said and done, Auroville and aurovillians - are quite cautious if you go around asking too many questions. But they are open to volunteers. Volunteers are people who pay auroville - to allow them to ‘serve’ in auroville.
15.  Lastly, If you go looking for ‘whats hidden’ in auroville. Or whats ‘bad’ about the place - I assure you there is plenty - just like any other place. And yet, I do feel that its a unique space - away from the usual urbanisation (although not completely) yet, its an effort. And its flawed - as anything human. If you do visit it, do make the most of it. There is a lot of good there too. I hope you find it…

It isn’t perfect. Nothing is. Besides, perfection is a very relative term when it comes to society. What you consider perfect may be severely flawed for me. So many people may just not like the concept of Auroville or what it stands for. Racists, for instance, would hate a place where different races and cultures mingle. The more conservative among us would also find it difficult to accept the freedom afforded to young kids there. But you’re talking about liberal people. Let’s get to that.

You can’t just become an Aurovillian because you want to. There’s a whole process. And often people don’t like to give up what they have (jobs in big cities, access to malls and theatres, luxury cars and big clean roads, big clubs with a lot of people partying, an airport nearby from where you can fly anywhere you want at a moment’s notice, etc. I’ve mentioned slightly richer things but you could also not want to move away from the security of actually owning a house (Aurovillians are given a house / land but it’s only theirs while they’re there. It isn’t transferrable or sellable), a strong job scene where you get paid more and more and can hop from company to company, a family life where you have some sort of control over your kids etc. That’s not just about being liberal or not, it’s something that many people crave for – stability, if you will, for want of a more suitable word right now.

The fact is that even if you want all that Auroville has, there’s still only a limited number of places going at a time. So there’s a waiting list. A process. A system. And it takes time. Which is actually a good thing since it avoids overcrowding and growing quicker than it can manage.

That said, the problems in Auroville are merely a reflection of the world. People don’t change just because they’re in a different place. I’ve met strong right-wing people there. I’ve also met people who are anarchists. It’s a society with a lot of different shades of grey. It doesn’t claim to be anything else really. The only thing that makes it special is the fact that there is a healthy respect for the others’ opinions, ideas and flaws. The only real rule is that you allow the other person the same freedom you’ve been afforded.

But you want concrete outward flaws? Well, there’s people who do drugs (like they do everywhere in the world), there’s people who believe firmly in some religion or God (like they do in many parts of the world), there’s people who moralise, preach, rebel, go wild at parties, have one-night stands, pray, cheat, lie, steal, behave badly, are rude… Remember, there’s people from all over the world there.

Admittedly, if you cross a line you’re sent away from the place which is something you can’t really do in a country or city, not until a legal line has been crossed at least. So the flaws abound. It’s an experiment. You need to want to be a part of it. And then live it. That isn’t easy. However liberal you may be.

It doesn’t help that you don’t earn any money in the community and work options in Pondicherry are very limited. But yeah, if you think you’re up for it, go give it a try. Start with being an Auroville Guest.

If you want to visit Auroville , I would suggest “Yes” but I would not suggest on settling there. Yes, I’m a Pondicherrian for the past 20 years.

You would see a lot of posts showcasing the beauty, “CASHLESS living” and lot of other bulls. But nobody will tell you the scandals, rumors and bad tales among the locals. Below said are my knowledge, it is your responsibility in confirming everything before Joining. Please comment if wrong.

1) To be an Aurovillian you must give all the assets in your name to Auroville. I also think you may contribute to their cause for a period of time in terms of Technical Skill and Experiences. At the end of the day you might wanna give some monetary aids or they might brainwash you into funding them. The talk around the locals is that “If you give auroville Nothing, they will not take you in”.

2) Auroville will make you work at harsh conditions at the initial period to test if you can sustain inside auroville.

3) Once you give the assets to auroville, it’s gone. They wont give it back even after you come out in a short period.

4) You can work in Auroville with negligible wages and contribute to their cause with nothing in return.

5) Auroville is a CLOSED COMMUNITY. When I say closed, it’s VERY PRIVATE Community. Though there are many Civil Rights Violation stories, nothing comes out to light.

6) They object any sorts Sexual Relationship if you become an Aurovillian. But it’s very common. If one gets pregnant, they must leave the society (empty handed).

7) You can’t reason the authority inside the Auroville. Power is vested within a certain Circle, it ‘REMAINS” with them. They are the decision making authority, you are just a bystander or I shall say puppet who dances to their whims & feed them with your time and money.

8) Yes, auroville inhabits RACISM and Regionalism. In all my visits inside Auroville. I have never seen a Black people inside the community. Now(2018) I see some coloured people Working in Cafe’s and other Places around Auroville. But I don’t know if they mingle with the “Auroville Community”.

I can list out much more……

Just CHECK the FACTS and Incidents beforehand.

EDIT 1 : I see a lot of Views but no upvotes for this answer. I would like to support my answer with a screenshot of a PAID advertisement drive conducted on a Facebook page. Read the Comment Section.  
As for to support the information that you need to contribute something before joining the place. visit this link  
[Joining Auroville](http://www.auroville.org/contents/93 "www.auroville.org")

> “Financial contributions
> 
> Both Newcomers and Aurovilians contribute a fixed monthly amount towards Auroville. These contributions are used to maintain the existing infrastructure of Auroville, including roads, health services, education facilities, Newcomer housing etc. Additionally, a one-time administration fee contribution is requested from everyone, and you will be asked to donate a repatriation fund amount. For foreigners a return ticket to their home country needs to be shown to the Financial Service, or an amount equivalent to the cost of such a ticket deposited with the Service. This latter sum will be returned to you should you decide or be requested to leave Auroville, or upon becoming an Aurovilian.”

Though the link says that the sum will be refunded, it wont be. I have seen cases. And refer to the Sisters’ case I mentioned earlier(links provided) is one of them.

As every other system, Auroville has it’s own downsides and defects along with the pros.

I will tell you the cons

-   Becoming an Aurovillian requires you to donate all your assets to Ashram (I have heard from the local peoples that, if you don’t give something they ain’t gonna take you in)
-   If you sever your ties with Ashram, you wont be given anything including your assets. You will be left a pauper.
-   They will give you three things “FOOD, JOB and SHELTER”, you must adjust with what you get.
-   You can’t question the system or the authority
-   You will loose your CIVIL RIGHTS
-   They are a closed community.
-   Even if you die inside, none will come to know about it

many more JUST search the Internet and you will find many News !!

Recently some sisters ratted them, filed case , TRIED SUICIDE ……….  
Lots and Lots of Propaganda, Scandal and other Crimes !!  
U better search the Internet and Ask the Locals for info
