Useful notes:
---
- Please keep in mind, that unlike most organizations which "*create tasks for people to get busy*", in TVP we "*find people for needed tasks*", so please don't abuse :]
-  TVP **websites** are mostly beyond the scope of this board, and only technical requests are relevant to this team. Requests of any non-technical sort should be directed to https://trello.com/b/uxIJDTGk/website-team instead.
